# Mathf

The `Mathf` class is a static class that provides a collection of mathematical functions and constants. The class contains functions for finding the trigonometric values such as sine, cosine, tangent, hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine, exponential, logarithmic, rounding, absolute value, minimum and maximum of two values, finding the square root, and finding the Nth root of a number. It also contains functions for finding the sum and product of a series of numbers given a specific range and an increment value. The class also defines the mathematical constant `e` (base of the natural logarithm) and `pi` $$(\pi)$$ (ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter).
